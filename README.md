# 📌 GFG Problem of the Day (POTD)

## 📖 About This Repository

This repository contains my daily solutions to **GeeksforGeeks' Problem of the Day (POTD)**. Practicing these problems helps me **strengthen problem-solving skills**, gain expertise in **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**, and prepare for **coding interviews** effectively.

Each day's problem is stored as a separate file with the format:
```
DAY_<day_number>_<problem_title>.*
```
